NetMotter is a command line client for using the MOT
(http://www.kielikone.fi/en/ ) dictionary. It requires Python 2.5 or
later and an existing MOT account. It has only been tested with
english and finnish dictionaries but there's no reason why it
shouldn't work with others too (except for maybe the parsing).

Stick your username and password in the environment before running
like so:

    export MOT_USER=jedi
    export MOT_PASS=sith

and now you can translate words using:

    netmot python
